# landing_page
My second project! This was mix between books and so many tutorials, however i completed the goal and I absolutely love the final layout. I hope you all enjoy it and let me know how i can enhance the landing page since it's not perfect and it will help me to do better work in future projects. I'm fan of simple things so that's what you gonna se here.
I've been focus on do things a little different, either way I learned so many things and I realized that I must keep learning and coding everyday to improve coding skills and learn to sort out problems (sometimes they are so many ones) that might appear on the way.

Thank u so much for watching, Happy coding! -Angel
